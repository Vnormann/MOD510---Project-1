    "1. No, generally we cannot use the double equals (==) operator to check for equality between two floats, because we cannot guarantee that a floating point is accurate to infinite precision. The only time this would work, is if the two floats are identical, i.e. their IEEE 754 representations are exactly the same. There are some finite floating numbers for which this is applicable, e.g. -999.25 (which is used as a NULL value in certain scenarios).\n",
    "2. A better approach would be to use something like the `math.isclose` function. Or write an implementation by hand which checks that the absolute difference between the numbers is less than a given tolerance. Another way could be to truncate the floats and check the resulting strings, though this would be less precise."
